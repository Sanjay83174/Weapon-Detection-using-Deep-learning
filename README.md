# Weapon-Detection-using-Deep-learning
This project focuses on building an intelligent weapon detection system using deep learning techniques to identify weapons such as knives and guns from images or video frames. The goal of this system is to support surveillance, enhance security monitoring, and help in early threat detection.

Working on it, just few days to deployment.
