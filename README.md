# Weapon-Detection-using-Deep-learning
This project focuses on building an intelligent weapon detection system using deep learning techniques to identify weapons such as knives and guns from images or video frames. The goal of this system is to support surveillance, enhance security monitoring, and help in early threat detection.


Weapon Detection And Alert System Using YOLO Deep learning Technique to Avoid Crimes And Theft.|

Python, Deep Learning.


Security is always a main concern in every domain, due to a rise in crime rate in a crowded event or suspicious lonely areas. Abnormal detection and monitoring have major applications of computer vision to tackle various problems. This project implements automatic gun (or) knife detection using a YOLO convolution neural network (CNN) based algorithm. The trained model able to do detect gun or knife based on the pre-trained yolo file and alert via buzzer and sends an alert to preset authorized user or police station attached with a captured scene.


Working on it, just few days to deployment.
